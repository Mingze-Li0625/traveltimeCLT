\title{Estimates mean and variance of each link}
\usage{
link_mean_variance(data, L = 5L, bins = unique(data$timeBin))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame of trips and their road level travel information, formatted as \code{trips}, see \code{trips} or \code{data(trips); View(trips)}.}

\item{L}{The minimum number of observation needed to estimate (and not impute) parameters. Default (\code{L=5}). see}

\item{bins}{a vector of predefined naming for time bins. Default \code{unique(data$timeBin)}.}
}
\value{
Returns a hashed environment with keys as \code{paste0(linkID.from,'.', linkID.to,'.', timeBin)} and values containing \code{list(mean, sd, imputed_mean, imputed_sd)} as the mean and standard deviation of travel time for each unit, while \code{imputed_mean} and \code{imputed_sd} indicate whether the calculated quantities are imputed or calculated from observed data.
}
\description{
\code{link_mean_variance} estimates the mean and variance of travel duration for each link in the data.
}
\details{
For links \code{(linkID.from, linkID.to, timeBin)} that have less than \code{L} number of observations, first they are imputed by \code{(linkID.from, timeBin)} estimates, if there at least \code{L} observations in that category, and second by \code{timeBin} estimates.

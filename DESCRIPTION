Description: Implements two methods for prediction of average travel time on a route. A general population-based prediction, and a trip-specific method. The population-based method provide an estimate of average travel time and asymptotic Gaussian-based prediction intervals. The trip-specific methods integrates route data to provide tight Gaussian-based predictive distribution. From which, average travel time and prediction intervals are supplied.
